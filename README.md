## Getting started

attach the interceptor to a dio instance as follows,
remember to keep the logging interceptor at last to log all headers & fields added from other interceptors

```dart
final dio = Dio();

dio.interceptors.add(DioCurlLoggerInterceptor());
```

## Usage

You can also have some customization as you want, you can:
- Customize how to print the curl (by default using `log` from `dart:developer`)
- You can determine whether to print the cURL `onRequest` or `onResponse` & `onError`
see the following examples for more

```dart
// Customize how to print the curl
final dio = Dio();

// Write to a file for example:
final Directory directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
final File file = File('${directory.path}/app_log.txt');

dio.interceptors.add(DioCurlLoggerInterceptor(onPrint: (final cURL) async {
  print('cURL is: $cURL');
  await file.writeAsString(cURL);
}));
```

```dart
// Determine when to print the cURL
final dio = Dio();

// [DEFAULT] this will print the cURL right before sending the the request to the server
dio.interceptors.add(DioCurlLoggerInterceptor(sendOnRequest: true));

// this will print the cURL once response arrive, either succeed or when exception happens
dio.interceptors.add(DioCurlLoggerInterceptor(sendOnRequest: false));
```
